## React MyReads Project ##

This react application allows you to search books with the google boook api (via Udacity content API) and add books to a reading list. You can categorise the books between 'Currently Reading', 'Want to Read' and 'Read'.

I created this project for my Udacity Front End Web Develpment Nanodegree.

## How to run

To get started developing right away:
